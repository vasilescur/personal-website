# Personal Website

My personal portfolio/resume website. Built using Jekyll, based on the [Github.dev](http://github.dev) framework.

## Customizations

I added a customizable system for managing content such as experience items and education, as well as featured repositories,
using objects in the `_config.yml` file. These objects are read and converted to HTML components automatically by the template
engine in the pages, allowing for easy expansion and customization.
